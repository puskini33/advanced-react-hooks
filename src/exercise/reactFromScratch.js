// Concepts
// 1. closure
// 2. State and setState are just managed inside React. State management and storing happens in React function.
// 3. // The situation complicates if you want to have multiple states and React has to manage multiple states for the component.
// Hooks are arrays. State is saved in these array. And apparently here it just manages the state in the array, not the array of the pair btw the state and the function callback
// React IIFE is initialized only once when the app is running, but Component is rendered multiple times.
// When Component is rendered multiple times, useState inside React is called, which sets the index, but state is not deleted, becuase it is defined outside of the functions: useState and render.
// I did not get what he meant when he said that setState is called asynchronously, and I think it just means that hooks is updated, but in the wrong place because it is the wrong index;
// In React, state is managed in a list and recovered based on the indexed order of the useStates in the component.
// Rules of Hooks:
    // Order in which Hooks are called matters; the same order must be kept
    // Hooks must be called in a React function component
    // Hooks must be called at the top of the function component
    // Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions


// React has the concept of a work loop. It checks whether there is any work to be done. This is when render is triggered.

            const state = hooks[index] || initValue;

            // freeze the value; each useState call will have a setState that will close over the value of _idx
            // a = 1;
            // b = a;
            // a = 3; b?
            //  when you assign a variable to another variable with a primitive value, you're copying the value,
            //  not creating a reference to the original variable.
